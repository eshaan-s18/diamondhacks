This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

I created this project using Next.js, React, and Typescript.
I used Firebase Authentication for admin authentication, and MongoDB Atlas for storing event data.
I used several Google Cloud APIs: Gemini, Google Translate, Google Text-to-Speech, Google Maps, Google Geocoding.

Thanks to DiamondHacks for this opportunity!
